to run the project first copy the files the download the required dependencies.

run the project through python app.py and the localhost server will be up running.

the thing to note here is that the project is still incomplete so any of your contributions matter me the most.

What is this project all about?
Well, I started creating this project during my free time. As I am a student of NIST Robotics Club this project is related to that.
in this project I am trying to create a website in Flask where you upload the picture of any robotic component so that the website will send the respective detail to the
AI selected by the user and then the AI will tell you what mistakes you made so that you can rectify your mistakes and proceed in your work without any further 
help from your collegues.
